# node-addon-api CMake Hello World

This project is a "Hello World" base project for Node C++ Addons using node-addon-api with CMake. It is also ready to use with CLion IDE.

It is based on:
- [node-addon-api "Hello World" project](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-examples/tree/main/1_hello_world/node-addon-api)
- [william's blog post](https://williamhoyle.ca/blog/2021/cmake-js)

with my improvements for better experience in IDEs.
